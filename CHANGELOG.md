## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Cross-tenant token authentication** — `NeevAPIMiddleware` no longer bypasses `TenantScope` when looking up the authenticated user; the scope now naturally rejects tokens from other tenants at the auth layer instead of relying on downstream `EnsureTenantMembership` middleware
- **`AccessToken` tenant scoping** — added `BelongsToTenant` trait to `AccessToken` model so token lookups are tenant-scoped, preventing cross-tenant token resolution before hash verification
- **Bearer token extraction** — API tokens are now only accepted via the `Authorization: Bearer` header; removed insecure fallback to query string and request body (tokens in URLs leak via logs, referrers, and browser history)

### Changed
- **Email verification extracted to dedicated middleware** — removed hardcoded email verification checks (with fragile bypass path lists) from `NeevMiddleware` and `NeevAPIMiddleware`; added `EnsureEmailIsVerified` middleware registered as `neev:verified-email` alias for consuming apps to apply where needed
- **Consolidated migration indexes** — merged all indexes from the separate `add_performance_indexes` migration into their original table creation migrations; deleted `2025_01_01_000013_add_performance_indexes.php`

### Removed
- **`platform_team_id`** column from `tenants` table — the concept of a "platform team" linked to a tenant was only used by CLI commands and had no runtime purpose; `CreateTenantCommand` still creates a default team when `--owner` is provided but no longer links it via a foreign key
- **`managed_by_tenant_id`** column from `tenants` table — the reseller/tenant hierarchy feature had no runtime implementation and the "platform as tenant" model conflicts with `TenantScope` design (platform operates as `tenant_id = NULL`)
- **`--tenant` option** from `neev:member:add` and `neev:member:list` commands — member management now requires `--team` directly
- **`--managed-by` option** from `neev:tenant:create` command
- `platformTeam()` relationship from `Tenant` model and `managedTenant()` from `Team` model
- `managedBy()` and `managedTenants()` relationships from `Tenant` model

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **TenantScope scopes to platform users when no tenant resolved** — when tenant isolation is enabled but no tenant is resolved, queries now scope to `WHERE tenant_id IS NULL` (platform users only) instead of silently running unscoped, preventing cross-tenant data leakage while supporting platform-level users
- Moved `TenantScope` PHPStan suppression from baseline to inline `@phpstan-ignore` comments colocated with the calls

### Changed
- **Renamed `current_team_id` → `default_team_id`** — clarifies this is a user preference (which team to land on after login), not the request-scoped team context (which comes from `TenantResolver`/`ContextManager`)
- **Renamed `currentTeam()` → `defaultTeam()`** on `HasTeams` trait — relationship accessor for the user's default team preference
- **Renamed `switchTeam()` → `setDefaultTeam()`** on `HasTeams` trait — persists the user's default team preference to the database
- **Renamed `switchTeam()` → `setDefaultTeam()`** on `TeamApiController` — API endpoint moved from `PUT /neev/teams/switch` to `PUT /neev/teams/default`

### Added
- `TenantResolver::runInContext()` — run a callback within a specific tenant/team context, with automatic state save/restore (useful for platform code provisioning tenant resources outside a request)
- `tenant_id` is now mass-assignable on `User` and `Email` models, allowing platform code to explicitly set tenant ownership when creating records outside tenant context

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- `Domain::$type` reference in `TenantDomainController` — column was removed in v0.4.0 polymorphic refactor but `store()` and `regenerateToken()` still referenced it
- `PasskeyController` using plain arrays instead of `PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor` objects for WebAuthn credential descriptors
- Unreachable ternary branch in `Password::checkPasswordWarning()`
- Redundant `stripos` Chrome guard in Safari detection (`LoginAttempt::getClientDetails`)

### Changed
- PHPStan baseline reduced from 318 to 109 errors (66% reduction)
- Added comprehensive `@property` docblocks to all 17 Eloquent models for static analysis and IDE support
- Added `@return static` to `model()` factory methods on User, Team, and Tenant for proper type narrowing
- `TenantResolver::resolvedContext()` now returns intersection PHPDoc type (`ContextContainerInterface & IdentityProviderOwnerInterface & HasMembersInterface`)
- Removed dead code branches where values are provably non-null (after `create()`, Socialite `user()`, etc.)
- Removed unnecessary nullsafe operators on type-hinted parameters
- Removed always-true `instanceof HasMembersInterface` check in `EnsureTenantMembership`

### Removed
- `test_callback_redirects_when_oauth_user_is_null` test — tested an impossible code path (Socialite `user()` never returns null)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-09

### Changed
- **Role management overhaul** — removed `role` column from `team_user` pivot table; roles are now exclusively managed via laravel-acl's polymorphic `acl_role_assignments` table
- `RoleController` is now generic — uses `assignRole()` for any resource (Team, Tenant, or null for global) instead of hardcoding Team pivot updates
- `TenantSSOManager::ensureMembership()` accepts both Team and Tenant via `HasMembersInterface & IdentityProviderOwnerInterface` intersection type
- `TenantSSOController` uses the resolved context directly instead of Team-only `current()` lookup
- `Tenant::hasMember()` checks direct `tenant_id` membership first, then falls back to indirect team membership
- `Team::addMember()` encapsulates pivot attach + role assignment

### Removed
- `role` column from `team_user` pivot table — use laravel-acl `assignRole()`/`getRole()` instead
- Dead `$team->default_role` code from 6 controllers (was never a real DB column)
- `addMember()` from `HasMembersInterface` and `Tenant` model (tenant membership is implicit via `tenant_id` at user creation)

### Fixed
- Role scoping now respects identity mode: Team when `team=true`, Tenant when `tenant=true, team=false`, global when both false
- SSO auto-provisioning works for both Team and Tenant contexts
- `Tenant::activated_at` / `inactive_reason` columns are now functional with `isActive()`, `activate()`, `deactivate()` methods

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-08

### Changed
- **Config overhaul** — reduced from ~30 keys to ~20 with 2 orthogonal identity flags (`tenant` + `team`)
- **Domain model** — polymorphic `owner` (morphTo) replaces `team_id` + `tenant_id`; plaintext verification token; DNS verification consolidated into single `$domain->verify()` method
- Progressive `login_throttle` replaces hard lockout
- Single `password_expiry_days` replaces soft/hard split
- Single `otp_length` replaces `otp_min`/`otp_max`
- GeoIP configs grouped under `maxmind` namespace
- All enforcement middleware is opt-in (none auto-applied)

### Added
- `NeevAuthenticatable` umbrella trait (combines `HasMultiAuth` + `HasAccessToken` + `VerifyEmail` + auth relationships + password expiry helpers)
- `EnsureTenantIsActive`, `EnsurePasswordNotExpired` middleware (opt-in)
- Domain re-verification support: `verification_failed_at` column, `VerifyDomainJob`, `VerifyAllDomainsJob`
- Domain events: `DomainVerified`, `DomainReverified`, `DomainVerificationFailed`
- Database indexes for frequently queried columns
- Domain-to-tenant cache (5 min TTL), auth settings cache (30 min TTL)
- Database schema documentation (`docs/db-schema.dbml`)

### Removed
- `EmailDomainValidator` service and all waitlist/free email logic
- 30+ obsolete config keys: `identity_strategy`, `tenant_isolation`, `tenant_auth`, `email_verified`, `require_company_email`, `domain_federation`, `magicauth`, `dashboard_url`, `frontend_url`, and more

## [0.3.0] - 2025-03-01

### Added
- Email verification method configuration (`email_verification_method`) — choose between 'link' or 'otp' verification
- `GET /neev/passkeys` endpoint to list user's passkeys
- `GET /neev/teams/invitations` endpoint to get user's invitations and join requests
- Verification method returned in API responses for email verification flows

### Changed
- `POST /neev/logoutAll` now keeps current session active and only logs out other devices
- Email verification flows now respect the configured verification method
- Improved code structure with separate `sendMailLink()` function

### Fixed
- Missing route imports and method corrections

## [0.2.0] - 2025-02-20

### Added
- **Identity strategy system** — choose between `shared` (users global, teams as collaboration) and `isolated` (users scoped to tenant, tenant resolved before auth) via `config('neev.identity_strategy')`
- **Tenant model** (`Ssntpl\Neev\Models\Tenant`) — dedicated identity boundary for isolated mode with slug-based resolution, managed-by hierarchy, and SSO ownership
- **TenantAuthSettings model** — per-tenant SSO configuration (mirrors TeamAuthSettings for isolated mode)
- **ContextManager service** — request-scoped singleton holding resolved tenant, team, and user; immutable after binding
- **Entity-agnostic contracts** — `ContextContainerInterface`, `ResolvableContextInterface`, `IdentityProviderOwnerInterface`, `HasMembersInterface` — same service code works for both Team and Tenant
- **MembershipService** — entity-agnostic membership checks via `HasMembersInterface`
- **IdentityProviderService** — entity-agnostic SSO/auth queries via `IdentityProviderOwnerInterface`
- **BindContextMiddleware** — locks ContextManager after middleware pipeline, clears after response
- **EnsureContextSSO middleware** (`neev:ensure-sso`) — enforces SSO-only access for teams/tenants with SSO configured
- **ResolveTeamMiddleware** (`neev:resolve-team`) — resolves team from route parameter (numeric ID or slug)
- **TeamScope** global scope and `BelongsToTeam` trait — team-level model scoping (complements existing `BelongsToTenant`)
- **`tenants` migration** — `id`, `name`, `slug` (unique), `managed_by_tenant_id` (self-reference for reseller model)
- **`tenant_auth_settings` migration** — SSO config for tenants in isolated mode
- **TenantFactory and TenantAuthSettingsFactory** for testing
- **Install wizard stubs** — published migration stubs for hard user isolation (`tenant_id` on users table)
- **Architecture documentation** — `docs/architecture.md` (identity strategy, tenant vs team concepts, context lifecycle) and `docs/architecture-internals.md` (interfaces, patterns, coding standards)
- Comprehensive test suite — 996 tests, 1886 assertions

### Changed
- **TenantResolver** now resolves `Tenant` in isolated mode and `Team` in shared mode via the `ContextContainerInterface` abstraction. Backward-compatible `current()` method still returns Team
- **TenantResolver** populates `ContextManager` automatically on resolution
- **Middleware pipeline** reordered: TenantMiddleware → ResolveTeamMiddleware → Auth → EnsureTenantMembership → BindContextMiddleware
- **TenantMiddleware** now uses `TenantResolver::resolve()` which handles X-Tenant header, subdomain, and custom domain resolution in a unified flow
- **EnsureTenantMembership** updated to work with `ContextManager` and `MembershipService`
- **TenantSSOManager** refactored to accept `IdentityProviderOwnerInterface` — works with both Team and Tenant
- **TenantSSOController** updated to use `ContextManager` for tenant resolution and `IdentityProviderOwnerInterface` for SSO
- **Team model** now implements `ContextContainerInterface`, `ResolvableContextInterface`, `IdentityProviderOwnerInterface`, `HasMembersInterface`
- **Domain model** gains `tenant_id` foreign key and `tenant()` relationship for isolated mode
- **AccessToken model** gains tracking fields (`last_used_ip`, `user_agent`, etc.)
- **BelongsToTenant trait** updated to be identity-strategy-aware — resolves to `teams` or `tenants` table depending on config
- **NeevServiceProvider** registers `ContextManager` as scoped singleton, registers new middleware aliases
- **TenantScope** updated to read from `ContextManager` instead of `TenantResolver` directly
- Minimum PHP version bumped to 8.3
- Dropped Laravel 10 support (Laravel 11.x and 12.x only)
- CI workflows updated for PHP 8.3

### Fixed
- Fixed copy-paste error in API reference docs — "Send Verification Email" response now correctly says "Verification email has been sent"
- Fixed duplicated "Customizing Routes" section in web routes documentation

### Documentation
- **docs/README.md** rewritten as organized documentation hub (Guides / Reference / Architecture)
- **docs/multi-tenancy.md** — added Identity Strategy section, ContextManager section, fixed TenantResolver method signatures, added BelongsToTeam docs, updated database schema
- **docs/configuration.md** — added `identity_strategy` and `tenant_model` options
- **docs/installation.md** — added multi-tenancy and architecture links
- **README.md** — added `identity_strategy` to feature toggles, middleware aliases table, updated database schema, added architecture docs link, added Contributing/Security links
- **CLAUDE.md** — updated with all new directories, models, middleware, services, traits, and patterns
- **TODO.md** — updated stale items (tests, PHPStan, Pint, CI now marked complete)
- Cross-links added between all documentation files
